                  <p>We are an online text vendor that specializes in contriving book bundles that tailor to sadists. By this, we mean for average folk (that's you) who need to gift reads to family and friends they may not get along with. We carefully select well written books that contain a narrative which is sure to shake the well-being of your targets. <br/><br/>Sound dark? Nah, it's perfectly normal, trust us! Sometimes the people we know need a little wake-up from their slumbering complacency, and that's where we come in. Nasty Reads has prepared book bundles that will engage your victims with dark and contorted meanderings to ensure their slow but rewarding evolution from being a total pain to a resourceful human being. <br/><br/>Still too dark? Don't worry, we offer self-help bundles with free shipping if you can fax us a doctor's form. Many of those who receive our bundles as gifts have thanked us for our services! We really do care. 
                  <br/><br/>See more on our Bundles page. In the meantime, enjoy browsing our fine page!
