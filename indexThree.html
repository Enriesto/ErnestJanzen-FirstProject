                  <h3>Book One: The Sorrows Of Young Werther</h3>
                    <p>Nothing can dampen a happy spirit like the sorrow (HAHAHAHAHA) ful tale of a young romantic's life gone wrong. The Sorrows Of Young Werther is one of the first tragic novels ever written, and remains a testament to the anguish and torment of a young man ill-equipped to cope with heartache. Someone you know that may be a little sad after this? That's why we included it! Goethe's tragic masterpiece is sure to tug on the strings of your loved ones and leave a lasting impression once finished.</p>
                  <img class="books" src="images/metamorphosis.jpg" alt="Ernest Janzen">  
                  <h3>Book Two: The Metamorphosis</h3>
                    <p>Have you ever wondered what it would be like to wake up one morning as an insect? Franz Kafka has! The text includes this story among others, each of which serve to punctuate the human condition with themes of alienation. It is our sincerest hope that whoever reads this pontificates on how it relates to their lives and their (meaningless) relationship to the world. They'll be better for it in the end, and it's all thanks to you.</p>
                  <img class="books" src="images/stranger.jpg" alt="Ernest Janzen">  
                  <h3>Book Three: The Stranger</h3>
                    <p>If Kafka doesn't convince your friend that life is absurd, Camus should execute that axiom with The Stranger. It's a short read that captures the short life, trial, and execution of a frenchman. It's an absurdist magnus opum, and a remarkably satisfying read for someone who loves a nihilistic narrative. Is your friend like that? No? Perfect.</p>
                  <img class="books" src="images/heroes.jpg" alt="Ernest Janzen">  
                  <h3>Book Four: The Heroes</h3>
                    <p>The mate you're gifting this to may actually really enjoy this book. Abercrombie writes with a bombastic style that excites every page you turn. His fantasy novels are among some of the most enjoyable you'll find in English. Why then, you ask, did we include it in this bundle? One word: gore. The Heroes is perhaps Abercrombie's most violent written work to date. Use your imagination of what happens on a medieval battlefield, and The Heroes has it (and then some!) captured with vivid story-telling. Of all the reads in our bundle, you'll likely be most amused by your giftee's response to this book.</p>
